strongswan (4.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Urgency medium because this new upstream versions no longer uses
  dbus and thus fixed the grave bug from the last Debian package. This
  version should transit to testing.
  * New upstream release. Starting with version 4.2.0, crypto algorithms have
    beeen modularized with existing code ported over. Among other improvments, 
    this version now supports AES-CCM (e.g. with esp=aes128ccm12) and AES-GCM
    (e.g. with esp=aes256gcm16) starting with kernel 2.6.25 and enables dead
    peer detection by default.
    Note that charon (IKEv2) now used /etc/strongswan.conf as its
    config file.
  * Drop patch to rename AES_cbc_encrypt so as not to conflict with an
    openssl method of the same name. This has been applied upstream.
  * This new upstream version no longer uses dbus.
    Closes: #475098: charon needs dbus but strongswan does not depend on dbus
    Closes: #475099: charon does not work any more
  * Apply patch to ipsec init script to fix bashism.
    Closes: #473703: strongswan: bashism in /bin/sh script 
  * Updated Czech debconf translation.
    Closes: #480928: [l10n] Updated Czech translation of strongswan debconf

strongswan (4.1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * DBUS support now interacts with network-manager, so need to build-depend
    on network-manager-dev.
  * The web interface has been improved and now requires libfcgi-dev and
    clearsilver-dev to compile, so build-depend on them. Also build-depend
    on libxml2-dev, libdbus-1-dev, libtool, and libsqlite3-dev (which were 
    all build-deps before but were not listed explicitly so far - fix that).
  * Add patch to rename internal AES_cbc_encrypt function and thus avoid
    conflict with the openssl function.
    Closes: #470721: pluto segfaults when using pkcs11 library linked with 
                     OpenSSL

strongswan (4.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable new configure options: dbus, xml, nonblocking, thread, peer-
    to-peer NAT-traversal and the manager interface support.
  * Also set the default path to the opensc-pkcs11 engine explicitly.

strongswan (4.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Closes: #455711: New upstream version 4.1.9
  * Updated Japanese debconf translation.
    Closes: #463321: strongswan: [INTL:ja] Update po-debconf template 
                     translation (ja.po)

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 15:15:14 +0100

strongswan (4.1.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force use of hardening-wrapper when building the package by setting
    a Build-Dep to it and setting export DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1 in
    debian/rules.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 14:14:48 +0100

strongswan (4.1.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ship our own init script, since upstream no longer does. This is still
    installed as /etc/init.d/ipsec (and not /etc/init.d/strongswan) to be 
    backwards compatible.
    Really closes: #442880: strongswan: postinst failure (missing 
                            /etc/init.d/ipsec)
  * Actually, need to be smarter with ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets. Not
    marking them as conffiles isn't the right thing either. Instead, now
    use the includes feature to pull in config snippets that are
    modified by debconf. It's not perfect, though, as the IKEv1/IKEv2
    protocols can't be enabled/disabled with includes. Therefore don't
    support this option in debconf for the time being, but default to
    enabled for both IKE versions. The files edited with debconf are kept
    under /var/lib/strongswan.
  * Cleanup debian/rules: no longer need to remove leftover files from 
    patching, as currently there are no Debian-specific patches (fortunately).
  * More cleanup: drop debconf translations hack for woody compatibility,
    depend on build-stamp instead of build in the install-strongswan target,
    and remove the now unnecessary dh_clean -k call in install-strongswan so
    that configure shouldn't run twice during building the package.
  * Update French debconf translation.
    Closes: #448327: strongswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates 
                     translation update

strongswan (4.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "I'm back from my long semi-vacation, and strongswan is now bug-free 
  again" release.
  * New upstream release.
    Closes: #442880: strongswan: postinst failure (missing /etc/init.d/ipsec)
    Closes: #431874: strongswan - FTBFS: cannot create regular file 
                     `/etc/ipsec.conf': Permission denied
  * Explicitly use debhalper compatbility version 5m now using debian/compat
    instead of DH_COMPAT.
  * Since there's no configurability in dh_installdeb's mania to flag 
    everything below /etc as a conffile, now hack DEBIAN/conffiles directly
    to remove ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets.
    Closes: #442929: strongswan: Maintainer script modifies conffiles
  * Add/update debconf translations.
    Closes: #432189: strongswan: [INTL:de] updated German debconf translation

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun, 03 Jun 2007 18:39:11 +0100

strongswan (4.1.1-1) unreleased; urgency=low

  Major new upstream release:
  * IKEv2 support with the new "charon" daemon in addition to the old "pluto"
    which is still used for IKEv1.
  * Switches to auto* tools build system.
  * The postinst script is still not quite as complete in updating the 2.8.x
    config automatically to a new 4.x config, but I don't want to wait any
    longer with the upload. It can be improved later on.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Apr 2007 21:33:56 +0100

strongswan (2.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with fixes for the SHA-512-HMAC function and
    added SHA-384 and SHA-2 implementations.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Feb 2007 20:19:45 +0000

  * New upstream release with interoperability fixes for some VPN
    clients.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Jan 2007 12:21:20 +0000

strongswan (2.8.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, now with XAUTH support.
  * Explicitly enable smartcard and vendorid options as well as a 
    few more in debian/rules.
    Closes: #407449: strongswan: smartcard support is disabled

strongswan (2.8.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update debconf templates.
    Closes: #388672: strongswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates
                     translation update
    Closes: #389253: [l10n] Updated Czech translation of strongswan
                     debconf messages
    Closes: #391457: [INTL:nl] Updated dutch po-debconf translation 
    Closes: #396179: strongswan: [INTL:ja] Updated Japanese po-debconf
                     template translation (ja.po)
  * Fix broken reference to a now non-existing config file. no_oe.conf
    has been replaced by oe.conf, with the opposite meaning. Changed
    postinst to deal with it correctly now, and also try to convert
    older config file lines to newer (e.g. when updating from openswan
    to strongswan).
    Closes: #391565: fails to start : /etc/ipsec.conf:46: include
                     files found no matches 
		     [/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf]

strongswan (2.7.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Another try on getting it into unstable.
    Closes: #372267: ITP: strongswan -- second fork of freeswan.
  * Call debian-updatepo in the clean target, in line with the openswan
    change for its version 2.4.6+dfsg-1.
  * Remove man2html, htmldoc, and lynx from the Build-Deps because we no
    longer rebuild the documentation tree.
  * Starting shipping a lintian overrides file to finally silence the 
    warnings about non-standard-(file|dir)-perms (they are intentional).
  * Clean up /usr/lib/ipsec somehow, again owing to lintian warnings.
  * Add po-debconf to build dependencies.

strongswan (2.7.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to the main Debian archive. This does no longer build
    the linux-patch-strongswan and strongswan-modules-source packages,
    as KLIPS will be removed from the strongswan upstream source anyway
    for the next major release. However, the openswan KLIPS could should
    be interoperable with strongswan user space.
    Closes: #372267: ITP: strongswan -- second fork of freeswan.
  * This upload removes the draft RFCs, as they are not considered free under
    the DFSG.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jul 2006 12:40:34 +0100

strongswan (2.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This release fixes a potential DoS problem.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 12:34:43 +0100
 
strongswan (2.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian packaging of strongswan. This is directly based on my
    Debian package of openswan 2.4.5-3.
  * Do not compile and ship fswcert right now, because it is not included
    in strongswan upstream. If it turns out to be necessary for supporting
    easy-to-use OE in the future (i.e. for generating the DNS format for the
    public keys from generated X.509 certificates), I will re-add it to the
    Debian package.
  * Also disabled my patches to use /etc/default instead of /etc/sysconfig for
    now. Something like that will be necessary in the future, but those parts
    of strongswan differ significanty from openswan.
